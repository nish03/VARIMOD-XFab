Statistical Stimulation for design of high yield circuits

Correlating the statistics of transistor's process parameters with the statistics of electrical
performance is a vital task in statistical modeling. This project describes the backward propagation of variance (BPV) method, a
numerical and machine learning technique for iteratively solving the statistics of parameters
from the statistics of electrical performance within the behavior of models encapsulated in SPICE. R programming is done to achieve the objective

In the second phase of the project R-Shiny tool has been developed
